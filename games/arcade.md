# Arcade Games

Arcade games are fast-paced, skill-driven experiences focused on timing,
reaction speed, and mastery. On FGL, arcade games are curated with adult
players in mind.

Typical genres include tower defense, racing, physics-based destruction,
and retro-inspired action games.

Skill-driven titles can be explored in the
<a href="https://fgl.com/tags/arcade/">Arcade category on FGL</a>,
which highlights games built around reflexes and replayability.
